We create classes (e.g. TestDependency1) created which are duplicate of the actual dependency classes (e.g. Dependency1) 
Both actual and duplicate classes implement the same interface (IDependency1). However, in our duplicate classes, we change the implementation
of the method (e.g. Dependency1Method()) from what implementation we have in the actual class. The implementation - which we control. 
Remember - the goal is to NOT test the dependencies. The goal is to test the method of the dependent class which would make use of the 
methods of dependencies.

Becuase we have the same interface implemented on actual dependency class and the dupliate dependency class, 
we can pass the duplicate dependency class in the dependent (e.g. Dependent.cs) class constructor.
