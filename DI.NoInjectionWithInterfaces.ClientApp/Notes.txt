The class library "DI.NoInjectionWithInterfaces.Dependents" has the reference of 
"DI.NoInjectionWithInterfaces.Dependencies"project. 
The "dependents" class makes use of interfaces. However It still needs the dependent class reference.
This makes "Dependents" and "Dependencies" coupled with each other.
