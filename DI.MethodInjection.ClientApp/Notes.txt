The class library "DI.MethodInjection.Dependents" does not have any reference of "DI.MethodInjection.Dependencies"project. 
The "dependents" class makes use of its "dependencies" classes via their interfaces.
Dependent class exposes interfaces of dependencies (IDependency1, IDependency2 and IDependency3) as as method parameters which can be 
assigned from outside the class (DI.PropertyInjection.ClientApp). This makes "Dependents" and "Dependencies" decoupled from each other.
